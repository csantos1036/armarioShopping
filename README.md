## Overview
### Description
Armario Viewing is an iOS mobile application that will allow users to share photos of the clothes in their personal closets. Armario means "closet" in Spanish, and "Viewing" signifies that it will be an application that allows other users to view these photos. Users can post photos of their clothing items listing where the clothes from, and other users of the app may save/like these photos for inspiration for their own wardrobe.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Website is view only, uses camera, mobile first experience.
- **Story:** Allows users to share their clothing items in their closet. Other users may view these items and create personalized wardrobes on the app for inspiration. 
- **Market:** Anyone that is looking to share fashion inspiration and takes pictures could enjoy this app. Ability to follow users based on their closets and like/save photos to "wardrobes" on the app. 
- **Habit:** Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like “Wardrobes” could encourage users to create different sets of wardroves.  Users can explore endless pictures in any category imaginable whenever they want. Very habbit forming!
- **Scope:** Armario Viewing is a very narrow scope. The app could eventually expand to include features for users to sell their clothing items they no longer want.
